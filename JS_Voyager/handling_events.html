      <strong>HANDLING EVENTS:</strong><ul>
<li>Some programs work with direct user input, such as mouse and keyboard actions. That kind of 
input isn’t available as a well-organized data structure—it comes in piece by piece, in real time,
and the program is expected to respond to it as it happens.</li> 
<li>Imagine an interface where the only way to find out whether a key on the keyboard is being pressed
is to read the current state of that key. To be able to react to keypresses, you would have to constantly read
the key’s state so that you’d catch it before it’s released again. It would be dangerous to perform 
other time-intensive computations since you might miss a keypress.</li>   
<li>It has to remember to look at the queue, and to do it often, because any time between the key
being pressed and the program noticing the event will cause the software to feel unresponsive. This
approach is called polling.</li>    
<li>Each browser event handler is registered in a context. In the described example we called 
addEventListener on the window object to register a handler for the whole window. Such a method can also
be found on DOM elements and some other types of objects.</li>
<li>Reacting to Events: A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an 
HTML element. To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute:
                                onclick=JavaScript</li>
<li>HTML Event Attributes: To assign events to HTML elements you can use event attributes.</li>
<li>Assign Events Using the HTML DOM:
    The HTML DOM allows you to assign events to HTML elements using JavaScript
    Assign an onclick event to a button element:  
    script
    document.getElementById("myBtn").onclick = displayDate;
    script/
    In the example above, a function named displayDate is assigned to an HTML element with the id="myBtn".</li>
<li>The onload and onunload Events:
They are triggered when the user enters or leaves the page.
The onload event can be used to check the visitor's browser type and browser version, and load the
proper version of the web page based on the information.The onload and onunload events can be used to deal with 
cookies.
      body onload="checkCookies()"</li>
<li>The oninput Event:
The oninput event is often to to some action while the user input data.
elow is an example of how to use the oninput to change the content of an input field.
    Example
    input type="text" id="fname" oninput="upperCase()"</li>      
<li>The onchange Event:
The onchange event is often used in combination with validation of input fields    
Below is an example of how to use the onchange. The upperCase() function will be called when a 
user changes the content of an input field.
    Example
    input type="text" id="fname" onchange="upperCase()"</li>
<li>The onmouseover and onmouseout Events:
The onmouseover and onmouseout events can be used to trigger a function when the user mouses over,
or out of, an HTML element</li>    
<li>The onmousedown, onmouseup and onclick Events:
The onmousedown, onmouseup, and onclick events are all parts of a mouse-click. First when a mouse-button
is clicked, the onmousedown event is triggered, then, when the mouse-button is released, the onmouseup event
is triggered, finally, when the mouse-click is completed, the onclick event is triggered.</li>
