      <strong>HANDLING EVENTS:</strong><ul>
<li>Some programs work with direct user input, such as mouse and keyboard actions. That kind of 
input isn’t available as a well-organized data structure—it comes in piece by piece, in real time,
and the program is expected to respond to it as it happens.</li> 
<li>Imagine an interface where the only way to find out whether a key on the keyboard is being pressed
is to read the current state of that key. To be able to react to keypresses, you would have to constantly read
the key’s state so that you’d catch it before it’s released again. It would be dangerous to perform 
other time-intensive computations since you might miss a keypress.</li>   
<li>It has to remember to look at the queue, and to do it often, because any time between the key
being pressed and the program noticing the event will cause the software to feel unresponsive. This
approach is called polling.</li>    
<li>Each browser event handler is registered in a context. In the described example we called 
addEventListener on the window object to register a handler for the whole window. Such a method can also
be found on DOM elements and some other types of objects.</li>
       </ul>
