     <strong>DOM:</strong><ul>
<li>When you open a web page in your browser, the browser retrieves the page’s HTML text and parses it.</li>        
<li>The browser builds up a model of the document’s structure and uses this model to draw the page on the screen.</li>
<li>This representation of the document is one of the toys that a JavaScript program has available in its 
sandbox. It is a data structure that you can read or modify. It acts as a live data structure: when it’s modified,
the page on the screen is updated to reflect the changes.</li>
<li>You can imagine an HTML document as a nested set of boxes. Tags such as body and /body enclose other
tags, which in turn contain other tags or text.</li>
<li>The data structure the browser uses to represent the document follows this shape. For each box, 
there is an object, which we can interact with to find out things such as what HTML tag it represents and which 
boxes and text it contains. This representation is called the Document Object Model, or DOM for short.</li>
<li>The global binding document gives us access to these objects. Its documentElement property refers to
the object representing the html  tag. Since every HTML document has a head and a body, it also has head and body 
properties, pointing at those elements.</li>
