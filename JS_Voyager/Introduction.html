 JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. 
 The language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web 
applications possibleâ€” applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload
for every action. JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide various forms of interactivity
and cleverness.

        It is important to note that JavaScript has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java. 
The similar name was inspired by marketing considerations rather than good judgment. When JavaScript was being
introduced, the Java language was being heavily marketed and was gaining popularity. Someone thought it was a good 
idea to try to ride along on this success. Now we are stuck with the name.
