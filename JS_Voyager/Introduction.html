		<p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS. It is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It is 
			the default scripting language in HTML. It is easy to learn. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JS on the client side for webpage behavior, often 
			incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JS engine to execute the code on users devices. It is a high-level, just-in-time 
			compiled language. It has dynamic tyipng, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, 
			functional, and imperative programming styles. JS engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a 
			variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<br><br> Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and 
			respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.<br><br> These tutorials will teach you JavaScript from basic to 
			advanced.
