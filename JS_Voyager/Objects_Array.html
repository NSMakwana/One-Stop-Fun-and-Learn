        <strong>OBJECTS:</strong><ul>
<li>You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.</li>
<li>Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
    This code assigns many values (Apple, 20, Red) to a variable named Fruits.</li>
<li>The values are written as name:value pairs (name and value separated by a colon).</li>    
<li>Furtherly, Objects can also have methods. Methods are actions that can be performed 
on objects.Methods are stored in properties as function definitions.</li>
<li>Inside the braces(refer Example-1), there is a list of properties separated by commas. Each property has
a name followed by a colon and a value. When an object is written over multiple lines, indenting
it like in the example helps with readability. Properties whose names aren’t valid bindin names or
valid numbers have to be quoted.</li>
<li>It is possible to assign a value to a property expression with the = operator. This will replace
the property’s value if it already existed or create a new property on the object if it didn’t.</li>
</ul>
        <strong>ARRAYS:</strong><ul>
<li>Arrays, then, are just a kind of object specialized for storing sequences of things. If you 
evaluate typeof [], it produces "object". You can see them as long, flat octopuses with all their 
tentacles in a neat row, labeled with numbers.(Refer Example-2)</li>
<li>If you have a list of items (a list of Fruit names, for example), storing the cars in single variables.
However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? The solution is an array! An
array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index
number. Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.</li>
<li>Spaces and line breaks are not important. A declaration can span multiple lines.</li>
<li>There are multiple JavaScript Array methods through which we can exhibit our work easily.</li>
