        <strong>REGULAR EXPRESSION:</strong><ul>
<li>A regular expression is a standard way of writing down a “pattern” of characters that is 
easily recognisable.</li>            
<li>A regular expression is a pattern of characters. The pattern is used for searching and replacing
characters in strings. The RegExp Object is a regular expression with added Properties and Methods.</li>
<li>Regular expressions are both terribly awkward and extremely useful. Their syntax is cryptic, and 
the programming interface JavaScript provides for them is clumsy. But they are a powerful tool for inspecting
and processing strings. Properly understanding regular expressions will make you a more effective programmer.</li>
<li>A regular expression is a type of object. It can be either constructed with the RegExp constructor or 
written as a literal value by enclosing a pattern in forward slash (/) characters.</li>
<li>Regular expression objects represent the same pattern:
    an a character followed by a b followed by a c. When using the RegExp constructor, the pattern is written 
    as a normal string, so the usual rules apply for backslashes. The second notation, where the pattern appears
    between slash characters, treats backslashes somewhat differently. First, since a forward slash ends the pattern, we 
    need to put a backslash before any forward slash that we want to be part of the pattern. In addition, backslashes
    that aren’t part of special character codes (like \n) will be preserved,rather than ignored as they are in strings,
    and change the meaning of the pattern. Some characters, such as question marks and plus signs, have special meanings in 
    regular expressions and must be preceded by a backslash if they are meant to represent the character itself.
