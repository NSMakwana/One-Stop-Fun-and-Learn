        <strong><italics>VALUES:</italics></strong> <ul>
<li>Imagine a sea of bits—an ocean of them. A typical modern computer has more than 30 billion bits in its 
volatile data storage (working memory). Nonvolatile storage (the hard disk or equivalent) tends to have
yet a few orders of magnitude more.</li>    
<li>To be able to work with such quantities of bits without getting lost, we must separate them into chunks 
that represent pieces of information.</li>
<li>In a JavaScript environment, those chunks are called values.</li>
<li>Every value has to be stored somewhere, and if you want to use a gigantic amount of them at the same 
time, you might run out of memory.</li>
<li>As soon as you no longer use a value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled as 
building material for the next generation of values.</li>
         </ul>

        <strong>STRINGS:</strong>
         <ul>
<li>The next basic data type is the string. Strings are used to represent text. They are written by enclosing 
their content in quotes.
                                 `Above the Sky`</li>  
<li>You can use single quotes, double quotes, or backticks to mark strings,as long as the quotes at the 
start and the end of the string match.You can imagine how putting quotes between quotes might be hard.
Newlines (the characters you get when you press enter) can be included without escaping only when the 
string is quoted with backticks (\‘).</li>
<li>To make it possible to include such characters in a string, the following notation is used: whenever
a backslash (\) is found inside quoted text, it indicates that the character after it has a special meaning. This
is called escaping the character.</li>  
<li>Strings, too, have to be modeled as a series of bits to be able to exist inside the computer. The way 
JavaScript does this is based on the Unicode standard.Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted, but 
the + operator can be used on them. It does not add, but it concatenates—it glues two strings together. The 
following line will produce the string
                                    "concatenate":
                            "con" + "cat" + "e" + "nate</li>        
         </ul>
         <strong>OPERATORS:</strong>
         <ul>
<li>Operators are the ones through which by using them we can exhibit several specific operations.</li>
<li>Types of JavaScript Operators:
There are different types of JavaScript operators:</li>
<ol>
<li>Arithmetic Operators</li>
<li>Assignment Operators</li>
<li>Comparison Operators</li>
<li>String Operators</li>
<li>Logical Operators</li>
<li>Bitwise Operators</li>
<li>Ternary Operators</li>
<li>Type Operators</li>
</ol>
<li>There are also some operations that can be applied to Boolean values themselves. JavaScript supports 
three logical operators: and, or, and not. These can be used to “reason” about Booleans. The && operator represents
logical and. It is a binary operator, and its result is true only if both the values given to it are true</li>
</ul>
