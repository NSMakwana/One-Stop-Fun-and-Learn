        <strong>FUNCTIONS:</strong><ul>
<li>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece
of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition,
to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</li>     
<li>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. </li>       
<li>A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword function. Functions have 
a set of parameters (in this case, only x) and a body, which contains the statements that are to be executed
when the function is called. The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped in braces,
even when it consists of only a single statement.</li>
<li>Some functions produce a value, such as power and square, and some don’t, such as makeNoise, whose only 
result is a side effect. A return statement determines the value the function returns. When control
comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value
to the code that called the function. A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to 
return undefined. Functions that don’t have a return statement at all, such as makeNoise, similarly return undefined.</li>
<li>Parameters to a function behave like regular bindings, but their initial values are given by 
the caller of the function, not the code in the function itself.</li>
<li>A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
    (parameter1, parameter2, ...)
The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}
    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
      // code to be executed
    }
Function parameters are listed inside the parentheses () in the function definition.
Function arguments are the values received by the function when it is invoked.
Inside the function, the arguments (the parameters) behave as local variables.</li>
<li>Function Return:
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":
    Example
    Calculate the product of two numbers, and return the result:
    // Function is called, the return value will end up in x
    let x = myFunction(4, 3);
    function myFunction(a, b) {
    // Function returns the product of a and b
      return a * b;
    }</li>
<li>The () Operator:
The () operator invokes (calls) the function:
    Example
    Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius:
    function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
      return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);
    }
    let value = toCelsius(77);</li>  
<li>Functions Used as Variable Values:
Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.
    Example
    Instead of using a variable to store the return value of a function:
    let x = toCelsius(77);
    let text = "The temperature is " + x + " Celsius";</li>  
<li>Local Variables:
Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.
Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
    Example
    // code here can NOT use carName
   function myFunction() {
      let carName = "Volvo";
      // code here CAN use carName
    }</li>   
</ul></pre>
