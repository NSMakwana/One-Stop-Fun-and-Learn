        <strong>FUNCTIONS:</strong><ul>
<li>Functions are the bread and butter of JavaScript programming. The concept of wrapping a piece
of program in a value has many uses. It gives us a way to structure larger programs, to reduce repetition,
to associate names with subprograms, and to isolate these subprograms from each other.</li>     
<li>A function definition is a regular binding where the value of the binding is a function. </li>       
<li>A function is created with an expression that starts with the keyword function. Functions have 
a set of parameters (in this case, only x) and a body, which contains the statements that are to be executed
when the function is called. The function body of a function created this way must always be wrapped in braces,
even when it consists of only a single statement.</li>
<li>Some functions produce a value, such as power and square, and some don’t, such as makeNoise, whose only 
result is a side effect. A return statement determines the value the function returns. When control
comes across such a statement, it immediately jumps out of the current function and gives the returned value
to the code that called the function. A return keyword without an expression after it will cause the function to 
return undefined. Functions that don’t have a return statement at all, such as makeNoise, similarly return undefined.</li>
<li>Parameters to a function behave like regular bindings, but their initial values are given by 
the caller of the function, not the code in the function itself.</li>
</ul>
